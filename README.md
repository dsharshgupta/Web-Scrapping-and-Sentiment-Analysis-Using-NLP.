# Web Scraping and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for web scraping articles from URLs and performing sentiment analysis on the extracted text. The script utilizes various libraries such as pandas, Beautiful Soup, NLTK, and requests to achieve this task.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this script is to extract text content from provided URLs, preprocess the text, perform sentiment analysis, and calculate additional metrics related to the content. These metrics include positive and negative word counts, polarity and subjectivity scores, average sentence length, fog index, and more. The sentiment analysis provides insights into the emotional tone and complexity of the text.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the required Python packages by running:
     ```
     pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 nltk tqdm
     ```

2. **Input and Output Files**:
   - Prepare an input Excel file (e.g., `Input.xlsx`) containing a column named "URL" with the URLs of articles you want to analyze.
   - Prepare an output Excel file (e.g., `Output Data Structure.xlsx`) to store the results of sentiment analysis.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - Open the provided Python script in an environment that supports the libraries used (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE).
   - Modify the paths to the input and output files in the script according to your file locations.

4. **Execution**:
   - Run the script. It will perform the following steps:
     - Scrape the content from each URL using Beautiful Soup.
     - Preprocess the text by tokenization, removing stop words, and other cleaning steps.
     - Perform sentiment analysis and calculate relevant metrics for each URL.
     - Store the results in the output Excel file.

5. **Interpreting Results**:
   - The output Excel file will contain sentiment analysis results and various metrics for each URL.

## Customization

- You can customize the stop words lists and positive/negative word lists to match your specific use case.
- The script may require adjustments depending on the structure of the web pages you are scraping.

## Notes

- This script assumes that URLs provided in the input Excel file contain articles or text content that can be analyzed for sentiment. Adjustments may be needed for other types of content.
